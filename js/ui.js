// A base Robot function.------
// Define three robot type functions (e.g. Drone, Bipedal, ATV).------
// Define at least 2 specific robot model functions for each type.
// Give each robot model a different range of health. For example, one model can have health range of 50-80, and another one will have a range of 60-120. To accomplish this, read about the Math.random() function in JavaScript.
// Give each robot model a different range of damage they do using the same technique.
